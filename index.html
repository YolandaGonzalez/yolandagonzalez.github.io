<h1> Which two websites are you most inspired by? </h1>
<p> I choose <a href="http://www.audiusa.com"> Audi USA </a> and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com"> The New Yorker </a>    </p>

<h1>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h1>
<P> Audi content feels more centered without being cluttered. The new Yorker has organized their content more structurely by dividing their content into sections as you scroll without repeating. The menu is smaller on both, but because they are placed where most expect to access. Both use positive space and yet subtlely which makes both sites effective and great for the eye.  </P>

<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>

<p>For Audi, the use of monochromatic tones is what gives focus to the hierarchy of the car. Their focus makes the overall flow less clutter. Since the first thing you see is the car, they make a clear statement about their overall target audience  before going below the fold to the rest of the information below.</p> <br>

<p>The New Yorker also starts of with a strong hierachy, but as you scroll below the fold there are differences. The negative space throughout sticks to one color to bring out the content or positive space. The content has been developed in a grid format with a break between structure, but all aligned within its grid. </p>
